## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Ethernet transport with beacon discovery and auto-connect
- TCP transport with configurable bind address and static peer support
- Docker sidecar deployment for containerized services
- Comprehensive node and transport statistics via control socket
- fipstop TUI monitoring tool with smoothed metrics and quality indices
- ECN congestion signaling and transport congestion detection
- Persistent identity with key file management (`fipsctl keygen`)
- Periodic Noise rekey with fresh DH for forward secrecy (FMP + FSP)
- Systemd service packaging with tarball installer
- Build version metadata: git commit hash, dirty flag, and target triple
  embedded in all binaries via `--version`
- CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format

### Fixed

- Spanning tree coordinate loop: reject parents whose ancestry contains us
- PMTUD per-destination path MTU check and ICMPv6 MTU field width
- Ethernet AEAD decryption failures caused by minimum-frame padding
- Link-dead detection skipping peers that never send data
- FMP version check added to TCP stream reader

### Changed

- GitHub repository moved from `jmcorgan/fips` to `fips-network/fips`

## [0.1.0-alpha] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- Core mesh routing protocol with greedy coordinate-based forwarding

- DNS resolver for .fips domain names (port 5354)
- Spanning tree construction with cost-based parent selection and
  flap dampening
- Bloom filter-based identity discovery protocol with reverse-path routing
